LangChain is an open-source framework designed to help developers build
powerful LLM-powered applications such as chatbots, AI agents,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and autonomous workflows.

  * LangChain consists of modular components that help integrate LLMs, memory,
   databases, APIs, and tools into applications.
  * LangChain provides easy integration with GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Mixtral,
   and other models. It acts as an abstraction layer to interact with different
   AI models.
  * Chains allow sequencing multiple LLM calls, prompts, and tools.
      Why Chains?
        - Combine multiple LLM calls
        - Use outputs of one model as inputs to another
        - Automate multi-step workflows
  * By default, LLMs are stateless, meaning they forget previous messages.
   LangChain provides memory modules to maintain conversational context.
       Why Memory?
         - Enables chatbots to remember previous interactions
         - Maintains user context in long conversations
         - Can use buffer, summary, or vector-based memory
  * Agents allow LLMs to dynamically decide which tools to use at runtime
   [AI Agents]
       Why Agents?
          - Allow AI to choose which tool to use dynamically
          - Enable multi-step reasoning
          - Can interact with APIs, databases, or external functions
  * RAG is a technique where LLMs retrieve external knowledge (e.g., from PDFs,
   databases, or APIs) before generating responses. [e.g - using a vector db]
       Why RAG?
           - Overcomes LLM knowledge limitations by retrieving external
            information
           - Improves accuracy by reducing hallucinations
           - Works with FAISS, Pinecone, ChromaDB, Weaviate, and other vector
            databases
  * Tools and API Integrations: LangChain can connect LLMs with external APIs
   such as:
      # Google Search
      # SQL databases
      # Python functions
      # Custom APIs
  * Architecture:

  * Why Use LangChain?
      ✅ Abstraction Layer – Works with multiple LLMs & APIs
      ✅ Memory Support – Enables conversational context
      ✅ Tool Integration – Connects to databases, APIs, and search engines
      ✅ Autonomous Agents – AI that decides its own actions
      ✅ RAG Support – External knowledge retrieval for better accuracy
  * Components:
      1. Models - Connects with GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.
      2. Prompts - Formats and optimizes queries to LLMs.
      3. Memory - Retains conversational context.
      4. Chains - Sequences multiple LLM calls.
      5. Agents - AI that autonomously decides actions.
      6. Tools - Connects LLMs to APIs, databases, and functions.
      7. Retrieval (RAG) - Fetches external knowledge from vector databases.

      1. Models - In LangChain, "models" are the core interfaces through which
       you interact with the AI models
       LLMs have the the ability to understand what you are saying [NLU] and
       generate context based replies [Context Aware Text Generation]. They are
       trained on the entire internet data and hence they are huge in size. So,
       big companies like Google, Open AI kept LLM files on a server and created
       APIs to expose them.
       Because there are many APIs from many LLMs [like GPT, Claude, Gemini,
       etc], hence we need an interface that has the ability to communicate with
       any API from any LLM. This is the use case of LangChain.

       LangChain supports both
         1. Language Models (LLMs) -> Generates text, answers questions, and
         processes language. e.g Chatbots, content generation, summarization,
         translation
         2. Embedding Models -> Converts text into numerical vector
         representations. e.g Search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
         clustering, similarity matching

       They serve different purposes in AI applications.

       2. Prompts - A prompt is the input text or query given to an LLM to
        generate a response. The quality and structure of the prompt
        significantly impact the model’s output.

          Prompts in LLMs -

          2.1 Zero-Shot Prompting (No Examples)
          A direct question without any context or examples.
          Used for general queries but may produce inconsistent results.
          Example:
          What is LangChain?

          ---

          2.2 Few-Shot Prompting (With Examples)
          Provides a few examples to guide the model’s response, improving
          accuracy.
          Example:
          Translate the following English sentences into French:
          1. Hello, how are you? → Bonjour, comment ça va?
          2. Good morning! → Bonjour!
          3. I love programming. →

          ---

          2.3 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting (Explain Step-by-Step)
          Encourages logical reasoning by asking the model to explain its steps.
          Example:
          Q: A bookstore sells a book for $20 with a 10% discount. What is the
          final price?
          Think step by step.

          ---

          2.4 Prompt Templates (Parameterized Prompts)
          Uses placeholders for dynamic inputs, making prompts reusable.
          Example:
          Explain {topic} in simple terms.

          (Replace `{topic}` with an actual topic, e.g., `Explain AI in simple
          terms.`)

          ---

          2.5 Self-Consistency Prompting (Multiple Attempts)
          Runs multiple versions of a prompt and picks the most consistent
          answer.
          Example:
          Solve the math problem:
          "If a train moves at 60 km/h for 3 hours, how far does it travel?"
          Generate multiple reasoning paths and choose the best answer.

          ---

        3. Chains
        A Chain in LangChain connects multiple components (LLMs, memory, tools,
        and APIs) to build structured AI workflows. Instead of making a single
        call to an LLM, chains allow you to:
          - Process multi-step tasks
          - Pass outputs between steps
          - Customize responses using memory and tools

        Types of Chains in LangChain

          3.1 LLMChain (Single-Step Chain)
            - A simple chain where an LLM takes a prompt and generates a
            response.
            - Best for single-turn interactions and structured input queries.

            Use Cases:
            - Basic Q&A
            - Text generation
            - Single-step NLP tasks



          3.2 SequentialChain (Multi-Step Chain)
            - Connects multiple LLM calls sequentially, where the output of
            one step becomes the input of the next.
            - Useful when a task requires multiple logical steps.

            Use Cases:
            - Summarization and text refinement
            - Data extraction and post-processing
            - Multi-step reasoning tasks

          3.3 TransformChain (Pre/Post Processing)
            - Applies custom transformations to input/output before passing
            it to an LLM.
            - Useful for normalizing, formatting, or modifying input before
            processing.

            Use Cases:
            - Data pre-processing (e.g., converting text case, cleaning input)
            - Post-processing model outputs
            - Formatting responses before displaying

          3.4 ParallelChain (RunnableParallel)
            - Runs multiple LLMs or tools in parallel and merges the results.
            - Allows simultaneous execution of different queries or models.

            Use Cases:
            - Generating responses from multiple models and comparing outputs
            - Fetching different perspectives on a topic (e.g., simple vs.
            technical explanation)
            - Running multiple API calls at once


          3.5 RouterChain (Dynamic Routing)
            - Routes user queries to different chains based on intent.
            - Helps categorize and direct different types of requests.

            Use Cases:
            - Directing queries to specific LLMs (e.g., history vs. science
            questions)
            - Dynamic workflow selection based on input type
            - Routing between retrieval and generation tasks

          3.6 ConversationChain (Memory-Based)
            - Uses memory to retain chat history for continuous
            conversations.
            - Enables long-term interactions by remembering past exchanges.

            Use Cases:
            - AI assistants and chatbots
            - Personalized recommendations based on past interactions
            - Continuous, context-aware dialogue

        4. Indexes
        Indexes in LangChain help structure and store data efficiently for
        retrieval, search, and augmentation in LLM applications. They are
        mainly used to enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
        improve response accuracy.
          - An index is a structured way to store documents, text, or
          embeddings for efficient retrieval.
          - It allows fast lookup and retrieval of relevant data when querying
          an LLM.

          Types of Indexes in LangChain

          4.1 Vector Store Index
            - Stores numerical embeddings of text to enable semantic
            search.
            - Used with databases like FAISS, Pinecone, ChromaDB,
            Weaviate.

            Use Cases:
            - Finding relevant documents in a retrieval-augmented generation
            (RAG) setup.
            - Searching large datasets with semantic similarity rather than
            exact keywords.
            - Storing and retrieving custom knowledge bases for AI
            assistants.

          4.2 Text Index
            - Stores raw text documents for direct search and retrieval.
            - Simple indexing method but lacks semantic similarity
            capabilities.

            Use Cases:
            - Basic document lookup without embeddings.
            - Keyword-based search within structured data.
            - Pre-processing text before converting it into embeddings.

          4.3 Inverted Index
            - Maps words to their locations in a dataset for fast
            keyword-based searches.
            - Commonly used in traditional search engines and text
            retrieval systems.

            Use Cases:
            - Full-text search with high-speed keyword matching.
            - Indexing large document repositories for lookup-based
            retrieval.
            - Used in hybrid search combining keyword and semantic
            retrieval.

          4.4 Hybrid Index
            - Combines vector search (semantic) with inverted indexing
            (keyword).
            - Provides the best of both worlds—semantic relevance and exact
            matches.

            Use Cases:
            - AI-powered search engines that need both semantic
            understanding and precise filtering.
            - Handling structured and unstructured data in a single index.
            - Optimizing retrieval performance when working with large
            datasets.

          [NOTE - start]
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          Indexing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
          Definition:
          - In RAG, indexes store external knowledge that an LLM retrieves
          before generating a response.
          - Instead of relying on pre-trained knowledge, LLMs fetch
          real-time information from indexed sources.

          ✅ How It Works:
          1. User Query → Converted into an embedding.
          2. Search in Index → Retrieves the most relevant documents.
          3. LLM Augments Response → Uses retrieved data to generate an
          accurate answer.

          ✅ Benefits:
          - Reduces hallucinations in LLM responses.
          - Enables AI to work with custom knowledge bases.
          - Improves accuracy and reliability in chatbot and enterprise AI
          solutions.

          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

          Summary: Choosing the Right Index

          | Index Type | Best For |
          |--------------|-------------|
          | Vector Store Index | Semantic search & embeddings-based retrieval |
          | Text Index | Basic keyword-based text retrieval |
          | Inverted Index | Fast keyword search within structured data |
          | Hybrid Index | Combining keyword and semantic search |

          => Use `Vector Store Index` when working with LLMs and RAG-based
          applications.
          => Use `Text Index` for basic document search.
          => Use `Inverted Index` when fast keyword-based search is
          required.
          => Use `Hybrid Index` for advanced search applications combining
          both methods.

          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        5. Memory
        Memory in LangChain allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to retain
        context across multiple interactions. Since LLMs are stateless by
        default, memory enables longer and more context-aware conversations
        - Memory is a mechanism that stores and retrieves past interactions
        to maintain conversation flow.
        - Used in applications where previous interactions should influence
        future responses

        Why Use Memory?
        - Enables context-aware conversations
        - Helps LLMs remember user preferences and prior exchanges.
        - Improves chatbots, AI assistants, and multi-turn interactions.

        Types of Memory in LangChain

          5.1 ConversationBufferMemory
            - Stores a fixed number of past interactions as plain text.
            - Useful for short-term context retention

          Use Cases:
            - Simple chatbot applications.
            - Short multi-turn conversations where a limited context window is
            needed.

          5.2 ConversationSummaryMemory
            - Generates summaries of past interactions instead of storing
            full conversations.
            - Optimizes memory usage while keeping essential context.

          Use Cases:
            - Long conversations where storing every message is impractical.
            - AI assistants that need a high-level understanding of previous
            exchanges.

          5.3 ConversationBufferWindowMemory
            - Stores only the last N interactions in memory.
            - Prevents memory from growing indefinitely.

          Use Cases:
            - Maintaining a rolling window of recent interactions.
            - Chatbots that need to remember only recent user inputs.

          5.4 ConversationKGMemory (Knowledge Graph Memory)
            - Stores structured facts extracted from conversations in a
            knowledge graph
            - Allows AI to reason over stored information instead of just
            recalling past messages.

          Use Cases:
            - AI assistants that need structured, factual recall.
            - Applications requiring entity-based memory storage.

          5.5 VectorStore-backed Memory
            - Stores memory in a vector database (FAISS, Pinecone,
            ChromaDB) for semantic retrieval
            - Enables AI to search past conversations based on meaning
            rather than exact words.

          Use Cases:
            - Long-term AI memory that can recall conversations contextually
            - Advanced chatbot systems that need deep context awareness


          [NOTES - start]
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

          How Memory Works in LangChain

          Conversation Memory Process:
          - User Input → AI processes the query.
          - Memory Storage → Saves conversation history in the chosen memory
          type.
          - Retrieval → Fetches relevant past interactions when needed.
          - LLM Response → AI responds based on both new input and retrieved
          memory

          Key Considerations:
          - Short-term memory (e.g., buffer/window memory) keeps recent
          interactions.
          - Long-term memory (e.g., vector memory) allows semantic retrieval.
          - Summary-based memory helps optimize storage while maintaining
          context.


          Summary: Choosing the Right Memory

          | Memory Type | Best For |
          |----------------|-------------|
          | ConversationBufferMemory | Simple chatbots & short interactions |
          | ConversationSummaryMemory | AI assistants needing compact memory |
          | ConversationBufferWindowMemory | Maintaining recent context in rolling conversations |
          | ConversationKGMemory | Storing structured knowledge & reasoning over facts |
          | VectorStore Memory | Long-term AI memory with semantic search |

          - Use `BufferMemory` for basic context retention
          - Use `SummaryMemory` for long conversations with reduced storage
          - Use `Vector Memory` for deep contextual recall and advanced AI
          assistants

          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          [NOTES - end]

        6. Agents
            Agents in LangChain allow AI models to dynamically decide which
            tools, APIs, or actions to use based on user queries. Unlike
            standard
            chains, which follow a fixed sequence, agents enable flexible
            decision-making.

              - Agents use LLMs to determine actions at runtime instead of
              following a predefined workflow.
              - They can call external APIs, tools, databases, or functions
              dynamically.

            Why Use Agents?
            - Enables adaptive AI systems that respond based on user intent.
            - Allows AI to use multiple tools (e.g., web search, calculators,
            APIs).
            - Can handle complex, multi-step queries dynamically.

            Components of an Agent

            ✅ Key Components:
            - LLM (Decision Maker) – The model decides what actions to take.
            - Tools (APIs, Functions, or Actions) – The agent calls these tools
            to fetch
            data or perform tasks.
            - Prompt (Instruction Guide) – Defines how the agent interacts with
            the tools.
            - Execution Loop (Iterative Processing) – Runs the agent repeatedly
            until a
            final result is generated.

            ✅ How It Works:
            1. User Query → Sent to the agent.
            2. LLM Decides Action → Determines which tool or API to use.
            3. Tool Execution → Runs the selected tool and retrieves results.
            4. AI Processes Response → Uses retrieved data to generate a final
            answer.

            Types of Agents in LangChain

            6.1 Zero-Shot ReAct Agent
              - Uses the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework.
              - The LLM decides and executes actions without prior training.

            Use Cases:
              - General-purpose AI assistants.
              - AI systems that can search the web or query APIs dynamically.

          How Agents Work in LangChain

          Agent Execution Flow:
            1. User Input → Agent receives a task.
            2. Decision Making → LLM decides the next action.
            3. Tool Execution → Calls an external tool/API if needed.
            4. Iterative Process → Repeats until the task is complete.
            5. Final Response → Outputs the final result to the user.

          Key Considerations:
            - Stateful agents require memory for context retention.
            - Stateless agents work independently without recalling past
            interactions
            - Tool selection should be optimized for efficiency.

          Summary: Choosing the Right Agent

          | Agent Type | Best For |
          |--------------|-------------|
          | Zero-Shot ReAct Agent | Simple, direct LLM-based actions |
          | Conversational Agent | AI chatbots needing memory |
          | Structured Agent | API interactions using structured input |
          | Self-Ask Agent | Multi-step reasoning & sub-queries |
          | Multi-Tool Agent | Handling multiple API calls dynamically |
          | Custom Agent | Enterprise AI & business-specific workflows |

          - Use `Zero-Shot Agents` for simple, direct queries.
          - Use `Conversational Agents` for AI chatbots with memory.
          - Use `Multi-Tool Agents` when interacting with multiple external APIs
